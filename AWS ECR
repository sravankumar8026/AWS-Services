📘 Amazon ECR – Theory for Easy Revision
1. What is Amazon ECR?
Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully managed container image registry provided by AWS.
It is used to store, manage, and retrieve Docker/OCI container images securely.

2. Why do we use ECR?
ECR is used mainly because it is:
Secure – integrated with IAM
Private by default
Highly reliable & scalable
Fully managed
Integrated with AWS services like ECS, EKS, Lambda
It acts as a central storage location for container images used in deployments.

3. Key Features of ECR
✔ Private Image Storage
All repositories are private unless you make them public.
✔ IAM-Based Access Control
You decide who can:
Push images
Pull images
Access repositories
✔ Seamless Integration
Works directly with:
Amazon ECS
Amazon EKs
AWS Fargate
AWS Lambda containers
CodeBuild / CodePipeline
✔ Image Vulnerability Scanning
ECR can automatically scan images for:
Malware
Vulnerabilities (CVEs)
Security risks
✔ Lifecycle Policies
You can automatically delete:
Old images
Unused tags
Older versions
This reduces cost and keeps the registry clean.
✔ Encryption

Images are encrypted:
At rest using KMS
In transit using TLS
✔ Replication Across Regions
You can replicate images across multiple AWS regions for:
Faster deployments
Disaster recovery
Multi-region architectures

4. How ECR Works (Simple Flow)
Create a repository
Login to ECR (authentication using AWS CLI)
Build Docker image locally
Tag the image with ECR URI
Push the image to ECR
Deployment services (ECS/EKS/Lambda) pull the image during launch
This is the same in real-time projects, only automated through CI/CD.

5. ECR Repository Types
✔ Private Repositories
Default. Access controlled using IAM.
✔ Public Repositories
Used for open-source projects.
Similar to Docker Hub.

6. Real-Time Usage
ECR is used in DevOps pipelines to:
Build the application into a Docker image
Push that image into ECR
Deploy using ECS/EKS/Fargate
CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) automatically authenticate and push images to ECR.

7. Benefits of ECR
No infrastructure to manage
Highly available and scalable
Secure access using IAM
Fast image retrieval for ECS/EKS
Built-in security scanning
Cost-effective and pay-per-use

8. Simple One-Line Definition
ECR is AWS’s private, secure, and managed Docker image storage service used to store container images for application deployment.
