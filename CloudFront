🌐 What is CloudFront?
Amazon CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service provided by AWS.
Its main purpose is to deliver content (websites, images, videos, APIs, files) to users faster by distributing it across multiple servers worldwide.

Instead of users loading data from a single server (like an S3 bucket or EC2 in one region), CloudFront serves content from the nearest AWS edge location.

⭐ Why do we use CloudFront? (Advantages)
1️⃣ Improves Performance (Low Latency & High Speed)
CloudFront stores cached copies of your content in edge locations around the world.
So users get data from the nearest location → faster load times.

2️⃣ Reduces Load on Your Origin Server
Since CloudFront caches content:
Your S3 bucket
EC2 server
Application load balancer
don’t get hit too frequently → better performance and lower cost.

3️⃣ Enhances Security
CloudFront integrates with:
AWS WAF (firewall)
AWS Shield (DDoS protection)
Origin Access Control (OAC) for restricting S3 bucket access
providing a secure delivery channel.

4️⃣ Cost Savings
CloudFront reduces:
Data transfer from your origin (S3/EC2)
Server CPU usage
S3 + CloudFront is cheaper than directly serving content from S3.

5️⃣ Global Availability

CloudFront has hundreds of edge locations worldwide.
Your app becomes globally accessible with consistent performance.

6️⃣ Supports Dynamic + Static Content
CloudFront can cache:
Static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, videos)
Dynamic content from APIs or websites

7️⃣ HTTPS/SSL by Default
CloudFront provides free HTTPS using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
You can serve secure content without additional cost.

🧭 Simple Real Example
If a user from USA accesses your S3-hosted website (origin in Mumbai):
Without CloudFront → Request travels to Mumbai (slow)

With CloudFront → Request hits nearest US edge location → Fast
