AWS EC2 Instance:

“In real-time DevOps, EC2 is used for hosting apps, Jenkins servers, container hosts, Kubernetes nodes, and bastion servers.
I handle provisioning, securing, CI/CD deployments, monitoring, and troubleshooting. 
Common issues I resolve include SSH failures, instance health issues, disk full errors, application crashes, ALB health failures, and high resource usage. 
I use CloudWatch, SSM, system logs, and networking tools to diagnose problems quickly.”

“In real-time projects, EC2 forms the backbone of application hosting, Jenkins CI/CD, Kubernetes nodes, bastion access, and monitoring/logging infrastructure.
As a DevOps engineer, I secure, configure, deploy, monitor, and troubleshoot these EC2 instances regularly.”

what is ec2 instance?
An EC2 instance is a virtual server in the cloud provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that you can use to run applications. 
It functions like a physical computer, allowing you to choose the operating system, CPU, memory, and storage you need, and you only pay for what you use. 
This provides scalability (Elastic Compute Cloud) to adjust resources as needed. 

types of ec2 instance?
An AWS instance type is a choice of virtual machine that determines the CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity available for your application. 
AWS provides a wide variety of instance types, which are grouped into categories like General Purpose, Compute Optimized, Memory Optimized, and Storage Optimized,
to help you match your specific workload needs to the right mix of resources. 

What an instance type determines
CPU: The processing power for your instance.
Memory: The amount of RAM available to your instance.
Storage: The type and amount of storage, such as EBS (Elastic Block Store) or local NVMe SSDs, is available to your instance.
Networking: The network and disk subsystem capacity, including network bandwidth, is allocated to your instance. 

what type of instance family you used in your project?
 we use R-Family , because our 3-tier application largely deals with database if you configure any type of R 
 R-series (Memory Optimized) – Best for most databases
Examples: R6g, R6i, R7g, R7i
Why?
Databases like MySQL/PostgreSQL/Oracle/MongoDB run best when most working data fits in memory.
High RAM → faster read queries.
Good balance of CPU + memory.
Use if:
You have high read/write load
Large DB cache
In-memory operations are important
✅ Most commonly used in real-time projects

what type of instance you used spot instance,reserved instance,dedicated host,saving plans,capacity reservation?
 in our project every time as per our reuirements we can create a new instance directly from create instance.
 but i have idea about all these types every type have they own advantage of saveing time,cost and etc ...

 what is AMI?
 “An AMI is a pre-configured template that contains the operating system, application software, and configuration required to launch an EC2 instance. 
 It acts as a blueprint for creating identical servers and is commonly used for scaling and automation.”

what is EBS?
“EBS (Elastic Block Store) is durable, block-level storage for EC2 instances. It acts as a virtual hard disk where we store the OS, logs, database files, and application data. 
EBS volumes are persistent, can be backed up using Snapshots, and come in multiple types like gp3 and io2 depending on IOPS and throughput requirements.”
