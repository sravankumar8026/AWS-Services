What is Amazon CloudWatch?

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service provided by AWS.
It helps you track, collect, and analyze data from your AWS resources, applications, and services — in real time.
Think of it as the “eyes and ears” of your AWS infrastructure.
It continuously watches what’s happening with your servers, applications, databases, containers, etc., and helps you respond automatically if something goes wrong.

Key Concept

CloudWatch works around Metrics, Logs, and Alarms:

Component	Description	Example
Metrics:	Numerical data points that represent the performance of your resources.	CPUUtilization = 75%, DiskReadOps = 500/sec
Logs:	Text-based event data generated by your applications or AWS services.	Application logs, Lambda logs, EC2 system logs
Alarms:	Set thresholds for metrics and take action when conditions are met.	Trigger an alert when CPU > 80% for 5 mins
Events: (or Rules)	Real-time event stream for detecting system changes.	Auto-restart EC2 when it stops
Dashboards:	Visual panels that show graphs, charts, and key metrics.	Display CPU, Memory, and Network graphs together

Example Use Case
Imagine you’re running a web application on EC2 instances:
You enable CloudWatch monitoring.
It tracks metrics like:
CPU utilization
Disk usage
Network in/out
Application log errors
You set an Alarm:
If CPU > 80% for 5 minutes → send an SNS notification (email or SMS) or scale up your EC2 using Auto Scaling.
You visualize all of this using a CloudWatch Dashboard.

Integration
CloudWatch integrates with:
EC2, Lambda, ECS, EKS, RDS, DynamoDB, etc.
AWS Auto Scaling → automatic scaling based on metrics.
SNS → notifications for alarms.
CloudTrail → for auditing API activities.

Why CloudWatch is Important
Benefit	                  Explanation
Proactive                   Monitoring	Detect and fix issues before they impact users.
Automation	             Trigger automatic actions (like restarting a failed instance).
Cost Optimization      	 Identify underutilized resources and reduce waste.
Performance Visibility	 Understand how your systems behave under load.
Security & Compliance	   Monitor unauthorized access or unusual activity through log analysis.
Unified View	           View data from AWS, on-premises, and hybrid systems in one place.
