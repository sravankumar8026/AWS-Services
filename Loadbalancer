Here is a clear, deep, interview-ready explanation of Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Network Load Balancer (NLB) with use cases, features, diagrams, and differences.

✅ Application Load Balancer (ALB)

Layer: L7 (Application Layer – HTTP/HTTPS/WebSocket)

The Application Load Balancer is used for web applications, microservices, and modern architectures.
It understands HTTP and HTTPS protocols, so it can inspect the request content and make intelligent routing decisions.

🔹 Key Features of ALB
1️⃣ Path-based Routing

Route traffic based on URL paths:

/login → Auth Service

/products → Product Service

/cart → Cart Service

2️⃣ Host-based Routing

Route based on domains:

api.example.com → API servers

admin.example.com → Admin application

3️⃣ Microservices Support

Each microservice runs on separate EC2/containers but ALB handles routing.

4️⃣ HTTPS/SSL Termination

ALB can decrypt HTTPS traffic using ACM certificates.

5️⃣ WebSockets Support
6️⃣ Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)

ALB can send a user to the same instance during the session.

7️⃣ Health Checks

Checks /health path of web apps.

🔥 When to Use ALB

Web applications (HTTP/HTTPS)

Microservices architecture

Path-based or host-based routing

When you want to offload SSL/TLS certificates

Dynamic routing based on URL or headers

Integration with ECS/EKS services

📘 Simple ALB Example
User → ALB → EC2-1 (Web Service)
            → EC2-2 (API Service)
            → EC2-3 (Auth Service)

✅ Network Load Balancer (NLB)

Layer: L4 (Transport Layer – TCP/UDP/TLS)

The Network Load Balancer is designed for high-performance, ultra-low latency, and millions of requests per second.

It does not understand HTTP.
It only forwards traffic based on IP and port.

🔹 Key Features of NLB
1️⃣ Handles Millions of Requests/Second

Extremely high throughput.

2️⃣ Ultra-Low Latency

Latency is usually under 1 millisecond.

3️⃣ TCP/UDP Protocol Support

Used for real-time applications.

4️⃣ Static IP Support

You can assign:

Fixed static IP

Elastic IPs

One static IP per AZ

Great for on-premise integrations.

5️⃣ TLS Pass-through

TLS certificates stay on backend servers.

6️⃣ Preserves Client Source IP

Backend servers can see real client IP.

7️⃣ Very High Performance Health Checks
🔥 When to Use NLB

Highly scalable applications

Real-time streaming

Gaming servers

Database traffic

Financial transaction systems

Applications needing static IP or EIP

Low latency TCP/UDP traffic

📘 Simple NLB Example
User → NLB → EC2-1 (TCP app)
            → EC2-2 (Database proxy)
            → EC2-3 (Real-time system)

🆚 ALB vs NLB – Quick Comparison
Feature	ALB	NLB
Layer	Layer 7	Layer 4
Protocol	HTTP/HTTPS/WSS	TCP/UDP/TLS
Routing	Path/Host-based	IP+Port
Performance	Good	Highest (millions of req/sec)
Latency	Milliseconds	Sub-millisecond
Static IP	No	Yes
SSL Termination	Yes	No (passes through)
Use case	Web apps, microservices	Real-time, high performance
Client IP Visibility	Via X-Forwarded-For header	Native
🧠 Real-Time Use Cases in Your DevOps Interviews
Application Load Balancer (ALB) Example

“In my microservice project, we used an Application Load Balancer to route traffic based on paths.
/auth requests were routed to the Auth service, /products to Product service.
ALB also handled SSL termination and health checks.”

Network Load Balancer (NLB) Example

“For high-performance internal communication between services, we used an NLB.
It gave us fixed IP addresses, very low latency, and supported TCP-based applications.”
